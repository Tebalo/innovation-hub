          <p className='lead'>Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.</p>
          <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
          <p>But then I found a <a href="#">component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.</p>

          <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
          <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;</li>
                <li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li>
                <li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on experience;</li>
                <li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.</li>
              </ol>
